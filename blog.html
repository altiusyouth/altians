                  Altius is a social education movement that we launched in India in 2009. Altius offers an alternative
                  education process to achieve both professional and life goals whilst also upholding moral values, love
                  and integrity. Most of the regular academic curricula are aimed at certification for securing jobs
                  that lead onward to one's professional goals. Altius is larger in scope. Altius’ alternative education
                  is aimed at assisting youth towards formulating and aiming to achieve the all-encompassing goals of
                  life, which one sets as ‘life’s mission in this world’.
                </p>
                <P>Prioritization: Altius also focuses on setting the priority between the goals of life and the
                  processes to achieve the goals. It is often the question on which of the two is more important. In
                  fact the balancing of the two is a trail that we all face in modern times. On account of increasing
                  competitiveness on the one hand, and the struggles of making marks of achievement in a short lifetime
                  on the other hand, it is commonplace for youth to be led to believe that achievement by whatsoever
                  means is all that matters. Professional goals therefore are overvalued. At Altius we say that an
                  experiencing journey is important. Also that one should reach the destination enjoying the sights on
                  the way. How one achieves any goal is as important as the process of achieving it. </P>
                <p>Altian thinking developed from the desire to see a young generation more inclined to value-based
                  lifestyle. We envisioned for youth the adoption of a lifestyle that upholds truth, love and service
                  mindedness en route to achievements and overall success. Youth need to be awakened from their
                  materialistic social conditioning and become aware of the spiritualistic parameters to lead a life
                  towards meaningful contentment. The Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad, Adi Sankara, Karl Marx, and Narayana Guru
                  are some that devoted their life to find paths to arrive at the true definition and right formula for
                  life. Teaching methods: People generally learn by seeing, reading, hearing and thus experiencing. What
                  is seen and experienced is assimilated faster than any other sensory learning process. Leaders set the
                  examples by what they do. Altius has a course modelled on a set of practices that help to evolve the
                  person. The lives of role models are discussed in Altius meetings. Main among them is Gandhi, Mother
                  Teresa, Che Guevara, Vivekananda and Narayana Guru. What is common in them is the unconditional love
                  for humankind. The lives and teachings of these great persons from recent history and related books
                  are discussed. Students are encouraged to individually evolve a spiritual formula which will act as
                  the beacon in their life. </p>
                <p>Reaching out: How do we do that? We target university students who are starting to think
                  independently and are also highly receptive to ideas and adaptive to change through education. So
                  Altius works among the youth. We send information requesting the university students to pen down their
                  ideas to transform the society by changing themselves. Altian students are selected through various
                  workshops at district, state, national and international level. Mentoring programs are conducted
                  regularly, where seniors mentor the juniors even outside the educational environment. They share
                  reflections on the good books they read and their great experiences in daily life in the online Altius
                  forums and workshops. Other practical learning methods include volunteering to run moral science
                  classes for high school students, engaging in farm assistance, volunteering to assist with household
                  chores etc. These tasks are essentially aimed at helping students to become public speakers,
                  self-reliant and to de-condition their ego. Through Altius the youth in the cities we operate usher in
                  a new civic culture of truth, love and ethics. When they smile they spread energy and the others get
                  recharged positively. Altians aim to become the inspiration to others to bring about a chain of
                  transformation. Altius’ vision is to better our lives and lives of others and thus make this world the
                  best place to live. The American cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead once wrote “Never doubt that a
                  small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that
                  ever has.” </p>

                  Every Altian keeps repeating that Alitus is a journey for being Globally Competent and Socially
                  Committed. Don’t we? Everyone knows at least something on the latter part of this slogan by being a
                  witness to various expressions of it. Or even some imitations of it… But what is it that you infer
                  from Global Competence? What all constitute this?<br><br>Global Competency is a Mindset?
                  The very question of Global competency arises only if one has a certain vision for his/her future. It
                  is a question of how you want to lead your life. If one is satisfied with the current atmosphere and
                  is confident of making most of it that assures a fulfilling life and career, then you can just take it
                  easy ! And I assure you, there is nothing wrong with it either ! It is strictly a personal point of
                  view and decision and we respect that. But if you think you are cut out for ‘bigger’ things (purely a
                  relative term here) in life, and you are looking at a professional life spanning continents and want
                  to achieve glory at an International arena, be our guest! But how you do it? But before that, let us
                  look at those primary visible ingredients for Global Competence. Once you know that you can comprehend
                  how to achieve each one of them more easily. All are advised to be in their formals and to be eager to
                  assimilate the nuances of English language before we start.. But will this be sufficient for this
                  sophisticated Journey? Let us go deeper into each component now
